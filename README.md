## File Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML template
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/              # Temporary file storage (auto-created)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)

You can customize the application by setting these environment variables:

- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` for debug mode
- `SECRET_KEY`: Custom secret key for sessions (recommended for production)

### Application Settings

In `app.py`, you can modify:

- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum file upload size (default: 16MB)
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Temporary file storage location
- `ALLOWED_COLUMNS`: List of columns to keep when filtering

## Data Processing Details

### Phone Number Processing

The application intelligently handles phone numbers by:

1. **Detecting Phone Columns**: Automatically finds columns containing phone-related data
2. **Unifying Data**: Creates a single "Phone Number" column from multiple phone fields
3. **Normalization**: Uses the `phonenumbers` library to convert to E.164 format
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid numbers are left unchanged rather than causing errors

### Location Processing

Creates a unified "Location" column by combining:
- City
- State
- Country

### Duplicate Removal

- **Email Duplicates**: Based on exact email address matches
- **Phone Duplicates**: Based on phone number matches (after normalization if selected)
- **Strategy**: Keeps the first occurrence and removes subsequent duplicates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Upload Fails**
   - Ensure the file is a valid CSV format
   - Check that file size is under 16MB
   - Verify the CSV has proper headers

2. **Phone Number Normalization Issues**
   - Invalid phone numbers are left unchanged
   - The app assumes US format for numbers without country codes
   - International numbers should include country codes

3. **Memory Issues with Large Files**
   - The application loads the entire CSV into memory
   - For very large files (>100MB), consider splitting the file first

### Error Messages

- **"No file selected"**: Choose a CSV file before uploading
- **"Please upload a CSV file"**: Only .csv files are accepted
- **"The uploaded CSV file is empty"**: File contains no data
- **"Error reading CSV file"**: File format issue or corrupted data

## Security Notes

- Files are temporarily stored on the server and cleaned up automatically
- Session data is used to track user files
- For production use, change the `SECRET_KEY` in `app.py`
- The application runs in debug mode by default - disable for production

## Development

### Adding New Cleaning Options

1. Add the new option to the HTML form in `templates/index.html`
2. Implement the cleaning logic in the `clean_dataframe()` function in `app.py`
3. Add the option description to the README

### Customizing the UI

- Modify `templates/index.html` for layout changes
- CSS styles are embedded in the HTML template
- Bootstrap 5 classes are used for responsive design
